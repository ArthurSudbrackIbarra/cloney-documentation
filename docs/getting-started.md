## Next Steps

Now that you have Cloney installed on your system, you're ready to start working with Cloney templates. Depending on your goals, you can choose one of two paths:

### User's Path: Using Cloney Templates as a User

If you want to leverage existing Cloney templates created by others, follow the path of a user. You can explore and clone templates tailored to various use cases. To get started as a user, head over to the [User's Guide](users/index.md) for detailed instructions on how to clone and customize Cloney templates.

### Creator's Path: Creating Your Own Cloney Templates as a Creator

If you're interested in crafting your own Cloney templates and sharing them with the community, follow the path of a creator. You can design templates, define variables, and empower others to generate projects based on your templates. To start creating templates as a creator, visit the [Creator's Guide](creators/index.md) for comprehensive guidance on template creation and customization.
