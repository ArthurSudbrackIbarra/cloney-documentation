# Official Cloney Documentation

Have you ever found yourself in the situation where you discover a fantastic template Git repository on GitHub, only to realize that it doesn't quite fit your unique project requirements? You're not alone. Traditional Git templates often leave you with the burden of customizing every detail manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Cloney comes to the rescue.

## The Pain of Manual Adjustments

Picture this: you stumble upon a promising template Git repository that could kickstart your project. Excited, you fork the repository, but soon, you realize it needs extensive adjustments. You have to replace placeholder values, tweak configurations, and adapt the code to match your project's specifications.

This process can be both frustrating and error-prone. Manually searching and replacing values throughout the codebase can lead to mistakes and inconsistencies. What if you could automate this entire customization process and have a template repository that adapts itself to your needs effortlessly? That's precisely what Cloney, a free and open-source tool developed in Go, is designed to do.

## Introducing Cloney Template Repositories

Cloney Template Repositories are the heart of Cloney's innovative approach. These repositories are enriched with a special `.cloney.yaml` metadata file that contains information about the template repository. This metadata file defines variables and configurations, making the template adaptable to various use cases.

With Cloney, you no longer need to manually tweak code, search for placeholders, or worry about consistency. Instead, you can:

- Define variables within the `.cloney.yaml` file, allowing you to customize different aspects of the template, such as project names, descriptions, and more.

- Use Go templates, a powerful and flexible templating language, to dynamically generate files and directories based on your provided variables.

- Focus on your project's unique requirements and let Cloney handle the repetitive and error-prone customization tasks.
