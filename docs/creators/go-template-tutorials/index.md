# Go Templates Tutorials

Welcome to the Go Templates Tutorials in Cloney. This guide will help you understand and utilize the core concepts of Go templates within Cloney, empowering you to create dynamic and adaptable template repositories.

## Introduction

Cloney's template engine is powered by Go templates, which are used to create and customize the content of your template repositories. Go templates provide a flexible and powerful way to define and generate text-based content. This guide will take you through various aspects of Go templates, all of which are fundamental to working effectively within Cloney.

## Variables

Learn how to create and use variables within your templates to store and manipulate data. Variables make your templates more dynamic and versatile. Check out the [Variables tutorial](./variables.md) to get started.

## Contexts

Understanding Go template contexts is crucial for creating dynamic templates. Discover the root context, local contexts, and how to access variables within different scopes. Explore the [Contexts tutorial](./contexts.md) to dive deeper into this topic.

## Conditional Statements

Create templates that react dynamically to various conditions. Use `if` and `else` statements to control content flow. Explore the [Conditional Statements tutorial](./conditional-statements.md) and make your templates adaptable.

## Loops and Iterations

Use iterations to loop through lists and apply templates to each element. Learn about the `range` construct and how to make your templates more dynamic. The [Loops and Iterations tutorial](./loops-and-iterations.md) is your gateway to mastering this concept.

## Functions

Enhance your template's functionality with built-in Go template functions. Perform operations, manipulate data, and generate dynamic content. Explore the [Functions tutorial](./functions.md) and expand your template capabilities.

## Hyphens

Discover how to control whitespace and formatting within your templates using hyphens (`-`). By using leading and trailing hyphens, you can achieve precise rendering. Learn more in the [Hyphens tutorial](./hyphens.md).
